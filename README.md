### Hello there...

🎓 My name is Santiago, and I'm in my last year of college studying Computer Science.

👾 Most of the time, I'm engrossed in coding projects related to video games—a topic that greatly inspires me.

🧭 I have experience with several popular programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and Python. Currently, Python is my primary choice due to its straightforward syntax and the abundance of interesting modules.

👀 Presently, I'm experimenting with OpenCV, mediapipe, and TensorFlow to develop a custom controller using a camera for multiple games. However, I'm also intrigued by Django.

👎 I strongly dislike frontend development; it simply doesn't appeal to me.
