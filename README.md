### Hello there...

ðŸŽ“ My name is Santiago, and I'm in my last year of college studying Computer Science.

ðŸ‘¾ Most of the time, I'm engrossed in coding projects related to video games.

ðŸ§­ I have experience with several popular programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and Python. Currently, Python is my primary choice but my goal is to continue learning C++.

ðŸ‘€ Presently, I'm experimenting with OpenCV, mediapipe, and TensorFlow to develop a prototype of a custom controller using a camera for 2D fighting games. However, I'm also intrigued by Django/Flask.

ðŸ‘Ž I strongly dislike frontend development.
