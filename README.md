### Hello there...

ðŸŽ“ My name is Santiago, and I'm in my last year of college studying Computer Science.

ðŸ‘¾ Most of the time, I'm engrossed in coding projects related to video games.

ðŸ§­ I have experience with several popular programming languages such as C/C++, Java, and Python. Currently, Python is my primary choice due to its straightforward syntax and the abundance of interesting modules.

ðŸ‘€ Presently, I'm experimenting with OpenCV, mediapipe, and TensorFlow to develop a custom controller using a camera for multiple games. However, I'm also intrigued by Django/Flask.

ðŸ‘Ž I strongly dislike frontend development.
