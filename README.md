### Hello there...


My name is Santiago, and I'm on my last year of college (Computer Science).

Most of the time I'm trying to code something related to videogames (not creating them yet).

I have experience with the most popular languages such as C/C++, Java and Python. 
I'm currently using Python the most since it's pretty straightforward and has a lot of interesting modules.

In the future I would like to keep pushing my C/C++ dexterity. I feel like is the final boss programming (excluding Assembly and binary) and I'm always up for a challange.
My idea is to start and Unreal Engine proyect to refresh eveything a bit.
