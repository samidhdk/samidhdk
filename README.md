### Hello there...


My name is Santiago and I'm on my last year of college (Computer Science).

Most of the time I'm trying to code something related to videogames (not creating them yet).

I have experience with the most popular languages such as C/C++, Java and Python, but I'm currently using Python the most since it's pretty straightforward and has a lot of interesting modules.
At the moment I'm tinkering with OpenCV, mediapipe and tensorflow to develop a custom controller for multiple games using a camera.


To be honest I would like to keep pushing my C/C++ dexterity at some point, I feel like is the final boss programming (excluding Assembly and Brainfuck) and minmaxing the performance of memory and time sounds at the same time stressful and interesting.

Additionally I study cybersecurity and competitive programming from time to time.
