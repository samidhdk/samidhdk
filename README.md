### Hello there...


🎓 My name is Santiago and I'm on my last year of college (Computer Science).

👾 Most of the time I'm trying to code something related to videogames (not creating them yet).

🧭 I have experience with the most popular languages such as C/C++, Java and Python, but I'm currently using Python the most since it's syntax is pretty straightforward and has a lot of interesting modules.

👀 At the moment I'm tinkering with OpenCV, mediapipe and tensorflow to develop a custom controller for multiple games using a camera. Nevertheless Django has caught my eye.

🕵️‍♂️ Additionally I study cybersecurity and competitive programming from time to time.
